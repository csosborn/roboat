Option 1:

Two [50W SunPower flexible panels](https://www.amazon.com/SunPowerÂ®-Flexible-Monocrystalline-Efficiency-Solar/dp/B07C34GHGV), arranged back to back with dead space (where the logo is) excised.

Advantages:

- Simple to build: cut down existing panels slightly, wire them up, fuse them to the deck.
- Likely more robust: encapsulation is less likely to fail.
- Likely higher performance: encapsulation is designed for solar cells.
- Built from 32 half cells, doubling the overall voltage. This opens the option of running a single array at 24V or two separately-tracked MPPT arrays at 12V each. The latter could provide benefits in the event of differential shadowing or fouling (or outright failure) of the fore and aft subarrays.
- Lends itself to construction of the deck in two halves, making fabrication easier. 
- No need for a boost MPPT

Disadvantages:

- Less control over geometry, cell count, etc. The overall array must be a composition of 4x4 cell squares.
- Not immediately clear how to affix the sheet material to the deck material. 

Option 2:

Between 27 and 32 full-size Maxeon solar cells, inset in plastic panel and encapsulated with clear resin.

Advantages:

- Complete control of geometry.
