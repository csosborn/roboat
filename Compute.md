# Compute

- Initial tests used a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W board as the main compute, but the 512MB of memory proved for containerized InfluxDB and Telegraf, never mind Grafana or actual application logic. 
- Testbed development now proceeding with a Raspberry Pi 3+ (1GB memory), which is performing better. 
- 8GB Raspberry Pi 4 on order.
